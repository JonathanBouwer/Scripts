# Jonathans Scripts

This is a repository for a bunch of arbitrary scripts I use for file management and the like. Only tested for windows but I'm sure it could be ported to linux without problems

The scripts probably depend on ffmpeg or python

image_combiner needs to be compiled with a C compiler, usage is passing in the 2 image file names to be combined vertically.
